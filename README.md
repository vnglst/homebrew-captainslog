# Homebrew tap for CaptainsLog

Install CaptainsLog on Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 26 or later:

```sh
brew install --cask vnglst/captainslog/captainslog
```

The cask installs the CaptainsLog app and the `cl` command line tool. The app is ad-hoc signed and not notarized; the cask removes macOS quarantine from the app bundle.

To uninstall the app and move its downloaded models to the Trash while keeping logs and configuration:

```sh
brew uninstall --cask --zap captainslog
```

Empty the Trash to reclaim the model storage. Models in folders you selected yourself are left untouched.
